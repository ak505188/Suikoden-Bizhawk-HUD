1. If you haven't been in an area with battles, switching from battle module and back to it crashes
  * Likely has something to do with the code that will show last battle area battles when not in area with battles
  * ex: enter from world map into gregminster
2. After setting new RNG via battle selection menu, RNG monitor blinks to different RNG for 1 frame(?) before being set to new RNG value. Happens on Circle exit and unpause exit

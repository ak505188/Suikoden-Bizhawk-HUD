1. ~~If you haven't been in an area with battles, switching from battle module and back to it crashes~~
2. After setting new RNG via battle selection menu, RNG monitor blinks to different RNG for 1 frame(?) before being set to new RNG value. Happens on Circle exit and unpause exit
3. When getting rid of all battle by adjusting Champ Val (or other potential means), Table will show `nil` instead of nothing
